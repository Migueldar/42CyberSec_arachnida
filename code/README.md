This proyect has 2 parts, spider and scorpion. Spider will scrape the web given recursively and download all the images found. Scorpion shows all the metadata of any given number of photos. I think the combination between both is obvious :). The folder in which the images go needs to be created before lauching spider.py, by default its ./data
